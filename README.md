Yes.

> Don't you want people to _know_ who you are?

They know I'm @JaPNaA.

> Yes, but like who _is_ "JaPNaA?"

Me.

... I'm interested in, uh, code?

日本語も、かな？

Well if they contact me first.

I dunno.

> What do you mean, _I don't know?_

I mean I have [social media accounts](https://japnaa.github.io/about), but I don't use it.

I do check my [email](mailto:leonehuang100@gmail.com), but strangers emailing me is scary.

And if you meet me in real life, I'll probably ignore you so.

> So it's impossible?

I mean, I said I check my [email](mailto:leonehuang100@gmail.com), but.

> No, no one needs to contact you.

_JaPNaA's imaginary friend stands up, stretches, and walks away._

> Ahh~! Finally, I'm done!
