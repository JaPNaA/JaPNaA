Hello! I'm JaPNaA (Just a Person Not an Alien).

I'm a second-year student majoring in computer science and a teaching assistant at the University of Toronto!

On my GitHub page, you'll mostly find the code that I've written for fun.

I'm interested in software design and machine learning.

Outside of code, I also do:
  - Japanese practice
  - illustration
  - story-writing
